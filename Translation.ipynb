A clear height of 1,100 mm from the \\ntop of the supporting surface should be ensured. The height of \\nthe installation surface above the floor is at least 850 mm. If the \\ncoffee machine connections are to be run downwards through the \\ncounter, please make space for the lines, which can reduce the \\nusable space below the machine.\\nInstallation dimensions of the \\nwater filter\\nSee the User Manual for the water filter.\\nThese specifications for the electrical connection and the standards quoted apply for connecting the coffee \\nmachine in EU countries. It may be necessary to also observe additional country-specific regulations. \\nOutside the EU countries, acceptance of the standards quoted is to be checked by the legal entity or \\nnatural person who wishes to use the coffee machine.\\nThe local power supply must be constructed according to IEC 364 (DIN VDE 0100). To improve safety, the device should \\nbe fitted with an FI 30 mA earth leakage current circuit breaker complying with EN 61008. (Type B residual current \\ncircuit breakers provide reliable tripping even if the fault current is smooth. This ensures a high level of safety.) Near \\nthe device or about 30 cm below the counter top there should be a shockproof socket as a single-phase connection \\ninstalled locally on the rear or side wall of the counter substructure or a country-specific single-phase socket. If the \\nmains cable for this device is damaged then it must be replaced by our service personnel or a similarly qualified person, \\nin order to prevent hazards. The mains cable must not come into contact with hot surfaces. The mains switch and plug \\ntop are part of the on-site installation. The coffee machine may not be fitted with a fixed permanent mains connection \\nif installed on a transporting trolley (a mobile station).\\nIn order to avoid possible faults from arising on our shielded data lines due to potential equalisation currents \\nbetween the devices, an additional potential equalisation unit should be planned for devices connected to the \\nvending system.
